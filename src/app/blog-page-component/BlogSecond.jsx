                                A reverse vending machine (RVM) is a device that collects used and empty bottles or containers and returns money or other types of incentives to recyclers according to the number of recycled receptacles. Wicanders, a Swedish business Wicanders in the latter half of the 1950s created this machine. Although it worked, it was incredibly basic and one-dimensional, accepting plastic bottles in one bottle at one moment. It could not accept any other recyclable materials like glass or aluminium, as well as huge volumes of bottles. In 1962, engineer Aage Tveitan developed a new reverse vending machine to upgrade the device. The machine could later be able to accept bottles constructed out of various recyclable materials as well as many bottles at once. The upgrade set the stage for how machines operate to this day.

                                Since consumers consume more than 1.4 trillion bottles of beverage each year, the world machine's goal is to reduce the generated waste. Most beverage bottles that are not recycled are spread across areas, landfills and rivers, and oceans. To reduce this trash to reduce the amount of waste, the RVM offers incentives to recycle. The incentives offered include cash refunds, contributions to charities, Metro Transit tickets, paid phone cards, and discount tickets for amusement parks, based on where the device is located. In light of these benefits, consumers are likely to be more motivated to recycle, as it benefits the environment and their satisfaction.

                                Reverse vending machines function by following a set of actions. In the beginning, the recycler inserts empty beverages in the hole for receiving them; the recycler inserts them into the receiving hole. After that, the bottle or can is turned to ensure it is so that there is an opportunity for the Universal Product Code (UPC) scanner can read the UPC of the bottle. The UPC is given to every unique trade product to indicate which manufacturing facility it came from. When the bottle is examined, recognized, and identified, it is added to the database to track the number of bottles the recycler is recycling. The containers for drinks are broken down into even smaller sizes to ensure greater storage space in machines that reverse vend. Recycling customers then have the choice of deciding what rewards they would like to receive. After the storage capacity is filled, the beverage containers are taken apart and then sorted by hand to ensure they are delivered to their individual recycling company.

                                There are numerous advantages to the use of reverse vending machines. One of the benefits is that they aid the environmental condition by recycling materials and decreasing the demand for raw materials in producing new beverage containers. RVMs are convenient to place in public areas, like supermarkets, gas stations, parks, schools, etc., which makes the containers easily accessible for people. They are easily managed because the machine can separate the recyclable material (plastic glass, aluminium, and plastic) rather than manually completing it. In addition, RVMs also have a capacity of 200 drink containers and 900 cans, which means they can store a large amount of stuff before being empty. While they can store a large amount of recyclable material, they are small equipment, meaning they will only take up a little of the area.

                                Additionally, RVMs can benefit businesses. Retailers with RVMs can offer specific incentives for their stores (i.e. coupons) to ensure that customers interested in recycling with the RVM will return regularly to shop and recycle. Also, because RVMs are incentive-based devices, environmental benefits are accruing, and recycling is too.

                                One of the disadvantages of the equipment is that they come with the high cost of acquisition or lease arrangements. The cost of one machine can range from $10,000 to $25,000. Given the high price, the machine is hard for businesses to afford many RVMs. But, an equally priced machine also available in easy locations is ATMs, which are automated machines (ATMs). While ATMs can be rented or purchased at a lower cost, ATMs can cost from $1000 to more than $25,000 and are profit-making in the long term. ATMs can make an average of 4320 and $7200 per year, charging $2.50 or 3 dollars per user. In the first up to four years following the lease or purchase agreement date, The ATM will begin to generate income from the first purchase or lease contract. They can become as profitable as ATMs. If the RVM can earn a hundred thousand cans every week at 10 cents for each can, it can make $100 per week. That's five times the amount of $5,200 per year. Between two and five years, the machines will profit from the initial cost. In addition, not only are RVMs ecologically friendly, they are cost-effective too.
