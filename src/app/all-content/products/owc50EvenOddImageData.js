        subtitle:"The Eco Cooler cools the laser and machine with water instead of chemical refrigerants, known as F-gases. During this process, the Eco Cooler saves up to 80% of the energy used for cooling, completely avoids hazardous substances, and saves tons of CO2 per year. The annual leak test for refrigerants is also not necessary thus reducing your maintenance costs. This enables you to achieve two objectives at once: save money and protect the environment.",

In many cases, no reworking is necessary. Your orders can be processed highly productively – independent of the component geometry. In comparison, microjoints fix the component in the scrap skeleton with a tab across the entire sheet thickness. Even though the procedure is also reliable when processing your orders with microjoints, the visible damage to contours usually requires time-intensive manual post-processing of the components. Part removal is more complex with thin sheet thicknesses, with mid-range sheet thicknesses it is almost impossible.",
